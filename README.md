# ROI(Region of Interest) Selector for the Counting Applications

- Hi there. This repo was created to determine the scene's regions of interest and save it in json format for use in object counting applications.
- As someone who has just started learning the C++ programming language, I wanted to make a good start by converting this repo written in Python to C++.([<img height="16" width="16" src="https://unpkg.com/simple-icons@v6/icons/python.svg" />](https://github.com/Acuno41/roiSelector-opencv-python))

- I hope the optimization and clarity of the code will be updated over time to become more understandable.
